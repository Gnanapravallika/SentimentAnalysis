# Sentiment Analysis with Python & Machine Learning
 # Project Description

This project is a simple yet powerful "Sentiment Analysis tool" that uses "Natural Language Processing (NLP)" and "Machine Learning" to classify text data into sentiments: "Positive", "Negative", or "Neutral".

It can be used to analyze:
- Product reviews
- Social media comments
- Customer feedback
- Any text-based data

---

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK / TextBlob / Vader (for NLP, depending on implementation)
- Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

---

##  How It Works

1. Preprocess the text: (remove stopwords, punctuation, etc.)
2. Convert text to vectors using `TfidfVectorizer`
3. Train a machine learning model (like Naive Bayes or Logistic Regression)
4. Predict sentiment of new text data
5. Display sentiment as `Positive`, `Negative`, or `Neutral`
